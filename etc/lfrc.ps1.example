# Shell commands with multiline definitions and/or positional arguments and/or
# quotes only partly work in Windows. For anything but the simplest shell commands,
# it is recommended to create separate script files and simply call them here
# in commands or mappings.
#
# Also, the default commands and keybindings are defined using cmd syntax (i.e. '%EDITOR%')
# which does not work with Powershell. Therefore, you need to override these
# with explicit choices accordingly.
