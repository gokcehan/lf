`lf` (as in "list files") is a terminal file manager written in Go with a heavy inspiration from [`ranger`](https://github.com/ranger/ranger) file manager.
See [faq](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf/wiki/FAQ) for more information and [tutorial](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf/wiki/Tutorial) for a gentle introduction with screencasts.

## Features

- Cross-platform (Linux, macOS, BSDs, Windows)
- Single binary without any runtime dependencies
- Fast startup and low memory footprint due to native code and static binaries
- Asynchronous IO operations to avoid UI locking
- Server/client architecture and remote commands to manage multiple instances
- Extendable and configurable with shell commands
- Customizable keybindings (vi and readline defaults)
- A reasonable set of other features (see the [documentation](doc.md))

## Non-Features

- Tabs or windows (better handled by window manager or terminal multiplexer)
- Builtin pager/editor (better handled by your pager/editor of choice)
- Builtin commands for file operations (better handled by the underlying shell tools including but not limited to `mkdir`, `touch`, `chmod`, `chown`, `chgrp`, and `ln`)
